# Where data and biology meet

The Greene Lab is a team of researchers at the [University of Colorado School of Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/) dedicated to answering important questions in biology and medicine with computation.
We focus on bringing together publicly available [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data), developing new computational methods to analyze that data, and creating tools to put those resources into the hands of every biologist.

# Research Interests
The research interests of our lab broadly span many areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Some of our main areas of interest include:

- Algorithms for high-throughput transcriptomics (RNA-seq)
  - assembly, quantification, de novo analysis, differential expression
  - gene expression analysis of single-cell sequencing data (specifically, single-cell RNA-seq)
- Data structures for indexing genomes and raw genomic data
  - data structures for building, indexing and querying one or more reference genomes
  - data structures for indexing collections of tens of thousands of raw sequencing experiments
- Applications of approximate and data-driven representations and data structures in bioinformatics
