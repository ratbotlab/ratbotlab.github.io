The COMBINE lab was created in the fall of 2014, when [Rob Patro](https://combine-lab.github.io/members/rob-patro.html) joined the [Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/).  In 2019, the lab moved to the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/).  Our research interests span many areas of computational / algorithmic genomics, but our core focus is on the development of algorithms, data structures, and statistical inference methods for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.

### Research Interests

The research interests of our lab broadly span many areas of computational biology and bioinformatics.  Some of our main areas of interest include:

  * Algorithms for high-throughput transcriptomics (RNA-seq)
    * assembly, quantification, *de novo* analysis, differential expression
    * gene expression analysis of single-cell sequencing data (specifically, single-cell RNA-seq)
  * Data structures for indexing genomes and raw genomic data
    * data structures for building, indexing and querying one or more reference genomes
    * data structures for indexing collections of tens of thousands of raw sequencing experiments
  * Applications of approximate and data-driven representations and data structures in bioinformatics
