Casey is a Professor in the Department of [Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/biochemistry) and the founding Director of the [Center for Health AI](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ai) in the [University of Colorado School of Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/).
His lab develops machine learning methods that integrate distinct large-scale datasets to extract the rich and intrinsic information embedded in such integrated data.
This approach reveals underlying principles of an organism’s genetics, its environment, and its response to that environment.
Extracting this key contextual information reveals where the data’s context doesn’t fit existing models and raises the questions that a complete collection of publicly available data indicates researchers should be asking.
In addition to developing deep learning methods for extracting context, a core mission of his lab is bringing these capabilities into every molecular biology lab through open, transparent science conducted by a diverse team of researchers.
Before starting the Integrative Genomics Lab in 2012, Casey earned his Ph.D. for his study of gene-gene interactions in the field of computational genetics from Dartmouth College in 2009 and moved to the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow from 2009-2012.
The overarching theme of his work has been the development and evaluation of methods that acknowledge the emergent complexity of biological systems.
