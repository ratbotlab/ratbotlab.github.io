- title: salmon
  type: software
  image: images/salmon_logo.png
  description: salmon is a tool for efficient, accurate, and bias-aware transcript quantification from RNA-seq data
  repo: combine-lab/salmon
  url: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon

- title: alevin-fry
  type: software
  image: images/salmon_logo.png
  description: alevin-fry is a suite of tools for processing single-cell sequencing data. It consumes RAD files generated by alevin, and performs common operations like generating permit lists, and estimating the number of distinct molecules from each gene within each cell. The focus in alevin-fry is on safety, accuracy and efficiency (in terms of both time and memory usage).
